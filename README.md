# Product Listing Page

This project implements a simple product listing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches product data from a fake API ([FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/products)) and displays it dynamically on the web page. Users can filter products by category, sort products by price, and search for specific products using the search bar.
